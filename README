This is an example of how to set-up and use static pages with the PHP
framework, Yii.

The problem is to find a method of creating hierachies of static pages.
i.e. something like /staticpages/blah/moreblah/evenmoreblah/fredview.php 

You can find the conversation that lead to this work here:
http://www.yiiframework.com/forum/index.php?/topic/3376-static-pages-again/

It follows on and adds to the yii wiki entry 'How to display static
pages in Yii?' found here http://www.yiiframework.com/wiki/22/

I built this project step-by-step, so if you want you can reset to any
commit and diff the changes, to see precsiely what was done.

After git cloning this project you will have a working webapp with
static pages. However, you will probably need to make the following
configuration chanes.

1. You'll need to point the yii root index.php at your yii framework.

2. You'll also need to adjust the RewriteBase in the root .htaccess to
   your project root.

3. If you clone to your public webroot then you'll need to give your
   webserver permissions to protected/runtime, say:

     sudo chown www-data:www-data runtime
